	abstract = {Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal diseases, with an average 5-year survival rate of less than 10\%. Unfortunately, the majority of patients have unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. Moreover, traditional treatments such as chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation have not been shown to significantly improve survival. Recently, there has been a swift increase in cancer treatments that incorporate immunotherapy-based strategies to target all the stepwise events required for tumor initiation and progression. The results in melanoma, non-small-cell lung cancer and renal cell carcinoma are very encouraging. Unfortunately, the application of checkpoint inhibitors, including anti-CTLA4, anti-PD-1, and anti-PD-L1 antibodies, in pancreatic cancer has been disappointing. Many studies have revealed that the PDAC microenvironment supports tumor growth, promotes metastasis and consists of a physical barrier to drug delivery. Combination therapies hold great promise for enhancing immune responses to achieve a better therapeutic effect. In this review, we provide an outline of why pancreatic cancer is so lethal and of the treatment hurdles that exist. Particular emphasis is given to the role of the tumor microenvironment, and some of the latest and most promising studies on immunotherapy in PDAC are also presented.},

	abstract = {No common malignancy is as rapidly and inevitably fatal as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). This grim fact has driven substantial research efforts into this disease in recent decades. Unfortunately, the investment has yet to result in a meaningful increase in 5-year survival. This has prompted many pancreatic cancer researchers and advocates to redouble their efforts, but also requires one to step back and ask why the previous efforts were lacking and to consider why pancreatic cancer is so difficult to treat. The difficulties are legion. PDA is characterized by an insidious clinical syndrome, but is rarely diagnosed at a time when surgical resection is feasible. We lack markers of early detection and screening programs remain unproven even in high risk populations. The location of the tumor in the retroperitoneum, the advanced age of patients, and the systemic effects of disease limit the options for local therapy. Chemotherapy may provide a small benefit, but most efforts to improve on the current regimens consistently and stubbornly fail in advanced clinical trials. The molecular and cellular features of ductal pancreatic tumors are aggressive and underlay multiple levels of therapeutic resistance. Non-cell-autonomous features including stromal proliferation, reduced vascular density and immune suppression also contribute to therapeutic resistance. Growing awareness of these the fundamental features of PDA has begun to guide ongoing research efforts. Clinical trials are now specifically targeting these tumor properties and actively focusing on the therapeutic implications of tumor stroma. As reviewed here, reflecting on the fundamental question of why pancreatic cancer is so difficult to treat is a necessary and informative exercise that will aid our efforts to improve patient outcomes. These efforts will lead to improvements in clinical trial design, expand our focus to include the molecular and histologic implications of novel treatment paradigms, and ultimately change the lives of our patients.},

KRAS wild-type tumors harbored alterations in other oncogenic drivers, including GNAS, BRAF, CTNNB1, and additional RAS pathway genes. A subset of tumors harbored multiple KRAS mutations, with some showing evidence of biallelic mutations. Protein profiling identified a favorable prognosis subset with low epithelial-mesenchymal transition and high MTOR pathway scores. Associations of non-coding RNAs with tumor-specific mRNA subtypes were also identified.

              mutation occurs in 50–75\% of human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC) following an initiating activating mutation in the
              KRAS
              gene. These p53 mutations frequently result in expression of a stable protein, p53
              R175H
              , rather than complete loss of protein expression. In this study we elucidate the functions of mutant p53 (
              
                Trp53
                R172H

                fl
              
              ), in a mouse model of PDAC. First we find that although Kras
              G12D
              is one of the major oncogenic drivers of PDAC, most Kras
              G12D
              -expressing pancreatic cells are selectively lost from the tissue, and those that remain form premalignant lesions. Loss, or mutation, of
              Trp53
              allows retention of the Kras
              G12D
              -expressing cells and drives rapid progression of these premalignant lesions to PDAC. This progression is consistent with failed growth arrest and/or senescence of premalignant lesions, since a mutant of p53,
              
                p53
                R172P
              
              , which can still induce p21 and cell cycle arrest, is resistant to PDAC formation. Second, we find that despite similar kinetics of primary tumor formation, mutant p53
              R172H
              , as compared with genetic loss of p53, specifically promotes metastasis. Moreover, only mutant p53
              R172H
              -expressing tumor cells exhibit invasive activity in an in vitro assay. Importantly, in human PDAC, p53 accumulation significantly correlates with lymph node metastasis. In summary, by using ‘knock-in’ mutations of
              Trp53
              we have identified two critical acquired functions of a stably expressed mutant form of p53 that drive PDAC; first, an escape from Kras
              G12D
              -induced senescence/growth arrest and second, the promotion of metastasis.},

Abstract
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive malignancy, and the seventh leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. An improved understanding of tumor biology and novel therapeutic discoveries are needed to improve overall survival. Recent multi-gene analysis approaches such as next-generation sequencing have provided useful information on the molecular characterization of pancreatic tumors. Different types of pancreatic cancer and precursor lesions are characterized by specific molecular alterations. Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of PDAC are useful to understand the roles of altered genes. Most GEMMs are driven by oncogenic Kras, and can recapitulate the histological and molecular hallmarks of human PDAC and comparable precursor lesions. Advanced GEMMs permit the temporally and spatially controlled manipulation of multiple target genes using a dual-recombinase system or CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. GEMMs that express fluorescent proteins allow cell lineage tracing to follow tumor growth and metastasis to understand the contribution of different cell types in cancer progression. GEMMs are widely used for therapeutic optimization. In this review, we summarize the main molecular alterations found in pancreatic neoplasms, developed GEMMs, and the contribution of GEMMs to the current understanding of PDAC pathobiology. Furthermore, we attempted to modify the categorization of altered driver genes according to the most updated findings.},
